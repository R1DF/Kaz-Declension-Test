# Kazakh Declension Test
This is a tiny project that can generate random Kazakh sentences using that can implement one of the 7 cases.<br>
The used alphabet is the **Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet**, which is set to be replaced by the 2021 Latin version after 2023. Whether I'll update this project to include the Latin version too, I don't know.

## Kazakh cases
This part of the README will explain the Kazakh cases in a _very brief_ manner.
1. **Nominative**<br>
The standard case. It highlights the subject and adds no endings.
2. **Genitive**<br>
Represents when something belongs to another thing. (e.g. Horse's shoe)
3. **Dative**<br>
Highlights a recipient/beneficiary of an action. (e.g. Give this to Adam)
4. **Accusative**<br>
Highlights the direct object of a verb. (e.g. in "I eat potatoes", "potatoes" is the direct object)
5. **Locative**<br>
Highlights when a noun is the location of something happening. (e.g. in Kazakhstan)
6. **Ablative**<br>
Highlights when something "comes from" something else, or "moves away from". (e.g. We're from Almaty)
7. **Instrumental**<br>
Highlights when something ie being used by or exists with another thing. (e.g. Bill playing with Sally)<br><br>

For more information, you can Google the case names individually or check [this website](https://kaz-tili.kz/su_npad.htm) out if you know Russian.

## Release?
No releases.<br>
I don't intend to make an executable out of this.<br>
If you really want to save it for some reason, then you need to have Python on your computer and just download
everything from the `/src/` folder.
