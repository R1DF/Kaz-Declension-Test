# Kazakh Declension Test
This is a tiny project that can generate random Kazakh sentences using that can implement one of the 7 cases.<br>
The used alphabet is the **Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet**, which is set to be replaced by the 2021 Latin version after 2023.

## Release?
No releases.<br>
I don't intend to make an executable out of this.<br>
If you really want to save it for some reason, then you need to have Python on your computer and just download
everything from the `/src/` folder.
